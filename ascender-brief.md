# Ascender Technologies Web Project Brief

## Overview
This brief is for a developer to **rebuild a website with the same content structure and design intent** as the original Ascender Technologies site. The focus is on **content, navigation, color scheme, and layout**—not the tech stack. The new site must:
- Replicate the **navbar and footer structure** (including dropdowns and their content)
- Use the **same color palette and font**
- Recreate the **main page's carousel with video and images, supporting text, and key sections**
- Implement all listed pages and dropdowns

## 1. Navbar Structure & Dropdowns
The navbar is the most important navigation element. It contains the following links, each with a dropdown ("mega menu") listing subpages or sections:

### **Navbar Links & Dropdowns**
- **About**
  - Company Overview
  - Vision & Mission
  - Leadership Team
  - Core Values
  - Sustainability
- **Industries**
  - Mining & Minerals (`mining.html`)
  - Energy & Power (`energy.html`)
  - Infrastructure & Construction (`infrastructure.html`)
  - Marine & Water (`marine.html`)
  - Telecommunications (`telecom.html`)
- **Solutions**
  - EPC Turnkey Solutions
  - Automation & Digitalization
  - Engineering Consulting
  - Sustainable Technologies
  - OEM Equipment Supply
  - Agriculture & Farming (`agriculture.html`)
- **Insights**
  - Project Portfolio
  - News & Press
  - Blog & Articles

## 3. Color Scheme & Font
**Primary Colors:**
- UCLA Blue: `#3e78b2`
- Cobalt Blue: `#004ba8`
- Outer Space: `#4a525a`
- Raisin Black: `#24272b`
- Custom Black: `#07070a`

**Font:**
- Inter, sans-serif

**Other Design Notes:**
- Use gradients (e.g., hero background: linear-gradient(135deg, #004ba8 0%, #3e78b2 100%))
- Buttons and links use hover color transitions (e.g., Cobalt Blue to UCLA Blue)
- Cards, dropdowns, and sections have soft shadows and rounded corners

## 4. Main Page (index.html) Design
### **Hero Section (Carousel)**
- **Full-screen carousel** with 4 slides:
  1. **Video**: Construction/EPC theme, auto-plays, muted, looped
  2. **Image**: Automation & Digitalization
  3. **Image**: Sustainable Technologies
  4. **Image**: Agriculture & Black Fly Farming
- **Overlayed text** for each slide (large heading, supporting subtitle, CTA button)
- **Carousel navigation dots** at the bottom center
- **Scroll indicator** (chevron down) at bottom right

### **Supporting Sections**
- **About**: Company intro, mission, vision, stats (years experience, projects, countries)
- **Leadership Team**: Cards with photo, name, title, bio, and social links
- **Industries**: Cards for Mining, Energy, Civil Infrastructure (icon, title, description, bullet points)
- **Solutions**: Cards for EPC, Consulting, Sustainable Tech (image, title, description, link)
- **Projects**: Cards for featured projects (image, title, location, description, completion date)
- **News**: Cards for news articles (image, date, title, summary, link)
- **Contact**: Form (name, email, company, message) and contact info (address, phone, email, map)

## 5. Pages to Create
- `index.html` (main page, as described above)
- `mining.html` (Mining & Minerals)
- `energy.html` (Energy & Power)
- `infrastructure.html` (Infrastructure & Construction)
- `marine.html` (Marine & Water)
- `telecom.html` (Telecommunications)
- `agriculture.html` (Agriculture & Farming)

Each industry page should:
- Use the same navbar/footer
- Start with a hero section (image or video, title, subtitle, CTA)
- Include a section for stats, solutions, and contact info
- Use the color accent for that industry (see original for reference)

---

## 6. Design Approach for Implemented Pages
- **Consistent use of color and font** across all pages
- **Dropdowns** are always visible on hover/click, with clear separation and soft shadows
- **Cards** for team, projects, solutions, and news use images, rounded corners, and subtle hover effects
- **Sections** are spaced with generous padding and clear headings
- **Mobile menu** collapses dropdowns into stacked links
- **Footer** is always present and matches the main page

---

## 7. Additional Notes
- **Do not copy code**—focus on content, structure, and design intent
- **All navigation and dropdowns must be present and functional**
- **Use the color palette and font as specified**
- **Main page carousel is the only design element that must be closely replicated**
- **All other pages should match the content structure and navigation**
