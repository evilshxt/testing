# Prompt for Cursor: Agriculture Project Page (Black Soldier Fly + Battery Cage)

## 🌐 Page Title:
Sustainable Agriculture Projects — EvilShxt Farm

## 🎯 Purpose:
Generate a responsive, professional web page showcasing agricultural innovations at EvilShxt Farm, focused on:
- Black Soldier Fly (BSF) protein farming
- Battery Cage poultry system
- Circular economy model (waste → feed → poultry → fertilizer)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- HTML + Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (only if needed)
- Layout should be responsive (mobile-first)
- Use icon placeholders and dummy images (`/images/bsf.png`, `/images/poultry.png`, etc.)

## ✍️ Sections to Include:

### 1. Hero Section
- Bold headline: “Building the Future of Agriculture”
- Subtext: “Black Soldier Fly Protein + Battery Cage Efficiency — Designed for Sustainability”
- CTA button: "Explore Our Projects"

### 2. Integrated Farming Model
- Split layout explaining the BSF + poultry cycle
- Include the following flow:
  Waste → BSF Larvae → Poultry Feed → Eggs & Fertilizer → Soil
- Use icons or images for each step

### 3. Featured Projects (grid layout)
Create 2–3 project cards using the format:
- Project Title (e.g., “BSF Pilot in Tarkwa”)
- Short summary
- Metrics (e.g., “100kg waste → 20kg larvae in 12 days”)
- Link or button: "View Report"

### 4. Educational Info Section
2-column layout:
- Left: Text explaining the benefits of BSF farming
- Right: Text on advantages of battery cage poultry systems
Use clear subheadings like:
- “Why Black Soldier Flies?”
- “Modern Egg Production, Reimagined”

### 5. Call to Action
Encourage users to reach out:
- “Interested in launching a farm like this?”
- Contact button (anchor to a form or contact page)

### 6. Footer
- Include contact info
- Social media icons (Instagram, WhatsApp, GitHub)
- Github repo link: [evilshxt/testing](https://github.com/evilshxt/testing)

## 📐 Styling & Layout Notes:
- Color scheme: Use soft greens, white backgrounds, and dark grays.
- Font: Use sans-serif fonts that look clean and technical.
- Animations: Optional fade-in on scroll (can use AOS if available)
- All sections should have generous padding and clean alignment.

## 🖼️ Image Placeholders:
- `/images/bsf-cycle.png`
- `/images/battery-cage.jpg`
- `/images/project-tarkwa.jpg`

## ✅ Extras (optional):
- Add a simple toggle section for “See full project details”
- Use Tailwind utility classes, no external frameworks needed
- Responsive grid for project cards (mobile 1-col, desktop 3-col)
